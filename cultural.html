		<h1>Cultural Analysis Project</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this paper and the reason I am writing it is because it saddens me when I see or hear about children and young adults are just loitering in their room playing a video game that, unless they get into a career that involves video games, is completely irrelevant to their lives. So to target this issue I am going to use the video game Call of Duty. I knew a great deal of people in my high that instead of doing their school work or even go outside to hang out with friends, just because they were “too busy” playing Call of Duty. I would like to stop the amount of time people spend on video games and at least have a few hours to go and spend time with friends and family. What I would do to solve this problem is set a law where you must spend at least 2 hours a day either exercising or spending time with people that are close to you.   </p>
		<p>Call of Duty is a huge culprit to this epidemic we are facing in today’s society. Call of Duty is a first person shooter, set in a war like scenario.  It has a game mode where you can connect online using the internet and play with other players that are also online. Once they are online they can play an array of game modes, most of which the object is to kill other players on the opposing team. This seems to be something that most young kids think is enjoyable, because everyone who I have ever met who played it, thought it was a brilliant game. </p>
		<p>I myself have played the game and I really didn’t find out what all the fuss is about. I would much rather go out and be social or at least go outside for a walk. When I played I didn’t exactly hate the game, but I definitely wouldn’t stay in and waste my whole day playing it. It could be that it’s just my type of video game, I play mostly sport games, such as Madden and NBA 2k. Even if that is the case, I don’t see how one could become so addicted to the game to where that’s all that they do ever. </p>
		<p> Most of friends who play Call of Duty call me crazy for even thinking that the video isn’t as fun as they say it is. They have told me that Call of Duty is “the funniest thing they have ever played, ever.”- My friend Juan Montes. He himself doesn’t stay inside, wasting away his playing Call of Duty, but he told that easily could if he didn’t have more important things to do, which I respect. I’m not trying to argue the game as a whole. You might fine Call of Duty or any other video for that matter, the best thing to be invented since sliced bread. Just as long it doesn’t take control of you and that’s all you can think about.  </p> 
		<p>Now, the controversy we are facing is the problem that more and more young children, young adults, and even full grown adults are ignoring life and continue to only focus on the video games they are playing. I first noticed this when I asked my brother if he wanted to go outside and toss the pig skin around while he was playing Madden. He initially ignored my comment, so I asked again, still nothing. Finally I demanded that he answer me and he said that he was too busy and then we would play later, but later never came. This happened when I was 13 years of age and it has progressively got worse as the years went by. He now is unemployed and still lives with my parents. </p>
		<p>I have confronted my brother many times about, in my eyes, his problem with playing video games. He brushes it off every time I bring it up. It’s getting so bad that he would now rather stay in my parents’ house unemployed and single squandering away his days and life, then go out with friends, go to a bar or club, and most importantly go out and search for a job. He once told me that video game isn’t his problem, it’s just that he doesn’t like going out and hanging out with friends. Which would be fine if that wasn’t a bold face lie. He used to have friends over every weekend before Call of Duty became introduced into his life. If it wasn’t for video games, mostly Call of Duty, I could with confidence say that my brother would have moved out of my parents’ house, he would have a job, and he would more than likely have a significant other in his life. Unfortunately, he loves and Call of Duty and we will never know if the above would have been true or not.</p>
		<p>What I would propose to do to stop this is, alert the parents, if they didn’t know already about the epidemic we are facing and tell the parents that they can help prevent their children become taken over by video games. To help get this started we could start sending out mass ads about getting their kids to go outside and have the children become more active in their everyday lives. Not only will this be more beneficial health wise, it will also benefit the children socially. </p>	
		<p>Going outside and playing can benefit the kids in a social matter because there are bound to be other kids outside playing as well. This gives children a chance to interact with other kids and create critical social skills that are going to be needed when they become adults and join the work force. This will prevent them from turning out like my brother, living at home, jobless, and lonely. That’s not the type of life I would I like to have for my children. </p>
		<p> I feel like my plan would work really well. If we were able to show the parents the possibly awful future that awaits their children if they don’t get away from the video games and hide themselves inside their home. I believe the parents would make the right choice when it comes down to it. There, of course, would be some bad apples and make the choice for their children to allow them to stay in all day and not do anything productive with their lives, but if we would be able to make a good campaign, we could easily reduce the number of obese children by at least thirty percent.    </p>
		<p>Also, we could get the schools involved more in the young one’s lives. A nationwide school campaign would be an excellent way to reach out to the kids and it would be a great way to get the children more involved in school. It would be a win, win situation, the kids get to interact with other kids, they get out of the house, depending on the types of activities the school does the kids might be getting active and therefore becoming more healthy, and finally they would be getting involved in school which is always a plus. </p>
		<p>Being involved with the school would be the most important benefit from the nationwide school campaign. We want the future of our great nation to be well educated. Education always come first in my book and most the time, kids these days will choose video games over studying or doing homework. This is going to hurt them in the long run when they have to do actual studying and tough homework when they get into college, if they even decide to go to college.  </p>
		<p>The whole purpose of this essay is because I just don’t want to see my little brother and sister have their lives consumed by video games. So far I have done my best to not let that happen. Whenever I get a chance I always take them outside to play, no matter what it is. Most of the time they’re the ones coming up with the games and I just go along with it. I hope with these efforts I can get them to go outside and enjoy life away from a television screen. I want them to go out and explore, to go and be creative. I am going to do what I can to make sure that happens, and so far I think I am doing a pretty good job that.</p>
		<p>I also noticed this in everyday life as well. The fact that we as a species are becoming independent on technology makes me sick. We should be able to go to the store with taking out our phone and playing some kind of app like candy crush and apps along those lines. I know that it’s not the same as playing video games on an actual T.V. but it’s pretty much the same premise. You are still getting controlled by technology. I’m scared to see what the future holds for us.</p>
		<p>I to, take my phone everywhere I go and I am also controlled by the apps on my phone. I try my best to keep my phone in my pocket so that way I don’t miss anything life has to offer. I also like the feeling of not using my phone as way to get out of an awkward social situation, which I believe makes you become less of an introvert and more of an extrovert. It has really helped me now that I’m in college and I have to make all new friends and I get put in situations that I’ve never had to been in. Because of this I like to leave my phone in my dorms at times and the only way I can be connected to the world is forcing myself to talk to others and make connections with strangers.   </p>
		<p>So to conclude this essay, I would like to say that it is a personal choice to either to play Call of Duty all day or to put the controller down and go enjoy life in its entirety. If you choose to stay in instead of going out, I am not going to judge you, because like I side, it is a personal choice and I am just stating my opinion on the subject. So please don’t approach me saying that I’m completely wrong and that you can do both play and hang out with friends, because I understand that. I’m just stating that from what I have observed, people who stay inside all day usually are awkward in social settings because they lack crucial social skills and they are also usually out of shape because they would rather stay inside then go out and get some kind of exercise. </p>

		<h1>personal memo</h1>
		<p>The issue we choose for our project was the Photoshop of models and how it affects societies view on beauty, but more specifically how it affects young girls. The issue at hand affected the way we composed our project in a way to which we had to make it very visual for the viewer. The group members and I came to the conclusion that to impact the viewer the most, we had to make the video very visual to show the effects of photo shopping models. Making this video also opened my eyes to the shady area of models and societies view on beauty. Me being a guy, I never had to worry about looking “pretty enough”, all I had to do was wake up, shower, and brush my teeth, then I’m ready for the day. Seeing the problems with the standards of beauty was a positive to come from the making of the video, but we did come into some trouble while creating the video, editing was a big obstacle for us. None of us had previous editing experience and none of us really knew how to set up a documentary, but in the end I feel that the video came out pretty good! </p>
		<p>We choose our issues because one of the girls in our group seemed really passionate about the issue so we decided that photo shopped models would the issues that we go make a video about. This was challenging to me however. I had no previous knowledge about the issue at hand, so making a documentary about something you’ve never heard off is kind of a hard thing to do, for me that is. Somehow the team and I made it work. We used the systematic approach in a way. We made sure that information was pretty easy to understand and repeatable.  </p>
		<p>During our research, YouTube videos were the most beneficial resources to our project believe it or not. Seeing how the process works and seeing the before and after pictures of the models was very beneficial to us and the project. Another beneficial resource we used were articles. We used these articles to get information about eating disorders. There were no resources there were not beneficial. I feel we could have used a grand number of resources and all of them would have been beneficial.  </p>
		<p>The collaboration on the project was really good. We all did our part and all helped on the end result. We were quiet and timid in the beginning, but when we started to talk more, there was no stopping us. I enjoyed working with a group and being able to bounce ideas off on another, it helps a bunch. The planning for the project wasn’t that good, we had a general idea before the start of the documentary and went off that as we went, but I still think the video was great and our team did a great job. There are a few things I would like to change if were allotted more time. I would like the video to have a little bit more flow to it and I would also like it to have a little more information about the issues as a whole. However I still believe that the video is great.  </p>
		<p>The most effective aspect of our documentary is the before and after pictures of the models. It shows the models before they photo shopped them and then it shows the models after they were photo shopped and it’s just amazing the difference between them. We came up with this idea as soon as we picked which issues we want to address. It was the first thing we brought up. That we should the models before and after and we were right. It is very effective.  </p>
		<p>I had fun making the documentary and I would possibly do it again.     </p>

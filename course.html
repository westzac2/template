		<h1>course retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>WRA 110 is an interesting class to say to the least. It is a lot different than what I thought it was going to be, but different in a good way. My idea of the class was that it was going to be writing pointlessly about a random a prompt given to us in class. It turns out that we still got told what to write about but we have a lot of lean way on exactly what we would have to write about and I like that. I like writing about things that I am interested in, it makes writing bearable because it’s more fun and immersive than writing a pointless essay that you have no interest in. Don’t get me wrong though, there is a bunch of writing in this class. So be prepared to write 3,000 word essays and ten page papers. Something that I was not exactly used to being a freshman and fresh out of high school. </p>
	  <p>The very first project we had to complete was the Lived Experience Project. This would count as my first writing assignment in college and I was nervous to say the least. I was nervous because of the stories I heard in high school. Most would say that writing an essay in college is nothing like writing an essay in high school, and for the most part, those stories were true. That didn’t stop me however. I took the project head on. </p>
		<p>The lived experience project was about our majors and why we chose that specific major to dictate the rest of our lives. My major at the time of the paper was chemistry. Chemistry, I found, was a hard major to talk about. I mean the only real reason I choose chemistry is because it was easy to me in high school and if you happen to go down the right career path, you can make the big bucks, which is why we all go to college in the first place right? Back to the essay, Along with writing about why we chose our majors, we also had to write about an event in our lives that helped us in deciding our majors. Again, I found this to be quite difficult. The only events in my life that had to with chemistry was, taking the class in high school and receiving a microscope for Christmas one year when I was very little. So, that’s exactly what I wrote about. I definitely had writers block while trying to think about how I would like to structure my essay. With all of the problems I faced while deciding what to put in my paper and what not to, the paper turned out half way decent! Not perfect however, I could of done better. If I had a chance I would, easily go back and write about my current major, which is supply chain management, and make my life at the time a whole lot easier. However, it was a learning experience. It helped shape the ways I write my essays and helped me understand how college essays should be written. </p>
		<p>The next project we had to complete was the Cultural Analysis project. This time we had to write about a social issue of our choice. I found this pleasing, because to me and I’m guessing most everyone, find it easier to write something that we are interested in or something that we are passionate about. I wrote about the social issue of children in today’s world who would rather play video games and stay inside than go outside and do some kind of physical activity. I feel very strongly that it’s these decisions that contribute to our obesity in America (along with not eating proper diets). Even more specific than children playing any kind of video game, I targeted the hit video game series Call of Duty or CoD as some would call it. </p>
		<p>This time the essay came so much easier to me. I wrote about why I was so passionate about the issue. I wrote about how the specific issue has affected me personally. Before you knew it, I had a whole 2,000 word essay done in a matter of a few days. There’s something about writing when you are actually interested in the subject or the prompt. The cultural analysis project was definitely one of my favorite projects that we did all semester. </p>
		<p>Our third project was easily the hardest project we had done all semester. It was called the Formal Research Project. It was a 3,000 word essay about our majors again or as the prompt put it, our academic disciplines. This was a major challenge for me. It was a challenge because at the time my major was still chemistry, and I had trouble writing a 1,500 word paper about chemistry, so the thought of writing a 3,000 word essay made me cringe, but unless I wanted to fail the class, which I certainly do not, I had to write the paper. So I did. It was extremely tough, not only because it was the longest paper I had ever written, but because I had to write about chemistry. However, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. It was a research paper so I had to describe what chemistry is, the benefits of having it as your academic discipline, and why it is beneficial to society and the economy. It wouldn’t have been so bad if it wasn’t so long. I was running out of things to say, I mean I’ve never had to write a paper that long before, and I wasn’t sure what to fill up my paper about. I ended up not doing too well on the paper, which isn’t a great feeling, but it was a learning experience once again and now in the future when I have to write a long essay, I won’t be intimidated and hopefully will do a lot better on it than the previous one. </p>
		<p>	Project number four had a twist to it, instead of writing a paper, we had to make a short 7 minute documentary, with a small group of 4, about one of the issues one of us in the group had wrote about previously in the semester. We decided to make our video on the process of photo shopping models to create our society’s “standard” on what a woman should look like. Personally, I thought this project was a fun one. I have always wanted to make a video of some kind and be able to edit it, and all that fun stuff. Also, I though the issue we chose to make a video about was interesting. I had no idea beforehand that professionals photo shop already beautiful women to make them look even more “beautiful” So not only did I have fun making a video and interviewing  people, I had also learned something in the process. </p>
		<p>There were a few kinks however. None of us really knew had to use the editing software, which is really important when you are trying to make a documentary. We did, after a little tinkering, figured out how to edit the documentary and after a slow start we made it happen. It was even a little bit longer than 7 minutes! It wasn’t the greatest documentary ever made, but it came out ok and we received a decent grade for it, which in the end, is all that really matters. </p>
		<p>The last project of the semester was as a class, we had to make a website and put all of our essays and videos on the website. My thoughts on the project were that this was a very intriguing, and a different means of doing a project. It’s not every day where you see a whole class come together and create a website, or anything really for that matter. However it is not finished yet, but I think it will turn out just great. Everyone is doing their part and its coming a long perfectly so far. I can’t wait to see the final result. </p>
		<p>I’ve learned a lot from WRA 110, mostly, things that I am going to need in future classes. For example, I learned what a college essay should look like (for the most part). This is going to come in handy so much in my future classes, because now I will have a better chance of getting a good grade on an essay that I might have to write in the future. Another thing I learned, was how to make a video, or at least edit one. This may not be put into use for any of my classes I am going to take, but if I have any free time outside of class and work, and I feel like doing something different, I might go out a create a video and upload it to YouTube, which wasn’t an option for before I had taken this class.  Most importantly, I learned that college isn’t easy, you really have to work for your grades. You can’t just show up to class and expect to pass like in high school. You actually have to put time in and work your butt off to get those grades that you want.   </p>

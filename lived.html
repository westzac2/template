		<p>The major I am considering is Chemistry. The reason I am considering chemistry because, I would like to become a dentist, and in order to make that happen I need a major in organic science. So, since I’m no good at biology or physics, chemistry would be an obvious choice. Also, I took an AP Chemistry class in high school and I loved it. It was one of the few classes that I actually enjoyed going to. It doesn’t hurt that I got a four point in the class. I know it’s a tough major to get into, especially since I’m no good at math, and I know there is a lot of math in chemistry, but I think it will be worth all the hard work because if I choose not to become a dentist there are plenty of other jobs I can get with chemistry as my major, like a chemical engineer for example. Being a chemical engineer would be a great job for me, next to being a dentist of course. </p>
		<p>Being a chemical engineer would be an excellent job because, I would be making good money and I would be doing something I enjoy in chemistry. I’ve been told that if you get a job doing something that you love, you never have to work a day in your life, and I want to be able to say that. So, if dentistry doesn’t work for me I have a backup plan. The money doesn’t hurt as well. An average chemical engineer makes an hourly wage of $47.17 and an average salary of $102,270 (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172041.htm LMD: March 29 2013). I could easily support my family with that kind of money, and that’s a huge part of me selecting my future career, that I am going to do for the rest of my life! Now of course my all-time first choice as of right now is becoming a dentist, but I wouldn’t mind my second choice as a chemical engineer. </p>
		<p>I came across chemistry as a major not only because of my class in high school, but when I was little I was obsessed with microscopes as a kid. So much in fact that I asked for one for Christmas. It was probably one of the best gifts I have ever received during Christmas, and I’m not just saying that! I really mean it! I don’t know why but it is just so amazing to me to be able to zoom in 20x and be able to see your individual skin cells (or whatever else you would like to see up close.). The microscope has had a lot of impact on me and my love for science, and later on, more specifically, chemistry.  </p>
		<p>I remember the first time I used a microscope, it was 8th grade, and my cousin had brought one over to my house because he had also gotten one for Christmas. We would find all kinds of stuff around my house and put them under the microscope, like; skin, Kool-Aid powder, salt and pepper, and cloth. Just seeing all this up, close, and personal was just mind-blowing to me. Looking at the random junk at the most basic level and observing what it really looks like is just as I said mind-blowing. </p>
		<p>So being newly introduced into this new contraption, and being mind-blown, I would naturally want to see me more. Therefore, that next semester I switched into the only open science class left, which so happened to be chemistry. It was one of my tougher classes I had, on the grounds that I wasn’t any good at math. I still passed the class and I enjoyed the class, I just wasn’t very good at it yet. I’m not someone who gives up easily so I took another science class the next year. I was also forced to take bio so I really didn’t have a choice. So, I stuck it out and 2 years later I’m taking an AP chemistry class and four pointing it as well. It was one of my prouder days in high school. However, the microscope isn’t the only reason I chose chemistry as a major.       </p>
		<p>Another reason I choose chemistry as my major was because it’s a major that if you get the right job, it will pay very well, like dentistry for example. An average dentist will make $150,605 a year! That is a boat load of cash! Like relating to what I said earlier I can comfortably support my immediate family and my future family. This is important to me because I came from a poor family, and seeing my mom and dad work hard to get to the spot where we’re at, really inspired me to work hard and be able to support my family and provide for my family. Growing up, most of the time we were living pay check to paycheck. Thankfully, it’s not like that anymore. Now we have a little bit more breathing room to spend on goods and pay bills. While I was growing up, I told myself that I’m going to college and I’m getting a good paying job and with chemistry being my major I can do that. So dropping out or failing out of high school was never an option to me, I was determined to go to college and thankfully I was blessed enough to get accepted to the best college in the world, MSU! </p>
		<p>I do have second thoughts about having chemistry as my major nonetheless. I mean, it is a tough major to get into, and math plays a huge part in chemistry. I’ve never been any good at math which worries me, because this means that I might not be, for lack of better words, smart enough to make chemistry my major. Then all of my hard work would have been for not and I don’t think I would be able to handle that kind of rejection. So I am just going to keep working hard, so hopefully, I will never have to experience the painful feeling of failure because I wasn’t smart enough. However, I have been seeing a math tutor, which has helped a lot! So, even though I have been going to a tutor for math, there will always some doubt in my mind, until I actually graduate, and get a good career of course.       </p>
		<p> All of these factors have helped me choose my major as chemistry. Which is really incredible when you think about it. The job opportunities, the huge amounts of money I could be making to support my family, my love for science, my cousin introducing me into the world of the microscope, and finally, the fact that I am actually good at chemistry, all of these random acts in my life combining to help pick my major, then later help me figure out what I want as my career, because a dentist isn’t really a dream job for most kids, but by chance, it is for me.  Now all that needs to happen, is for me to understand the math part of chemistry. If I could make that happen, I would be able to rest easy knowing that I would have a really admirable future ahead of me, but for now, I have to work hard and keep my mind focused on my studies.

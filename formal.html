			<p>Chemistry is the academic discipline that I would like to write about. It is also my current major, but I don’t know for how long however. Chemistry involves a lot of mathematics, and I am not too good at math unfortunately, so that creates a huge problem for me. Be that as it may, I do need chemistry as my major to get into the school I would love to get into, which is the school of Dentistry at the University of Colorado. One of the requirements is to major in any kind of sciences I believe, and chemistry fits in that criteria. During this essay, I am going to talk about why I came to the conclusion to possess chemistry as my major, the benefits of having a major in chemistry, the uses of chemistry in the work place and everyday life, and how chemistry has helped and assisted in everyday life, and even how chemistry helped with the economy. </p>
		        <p>I stumbled across chemistry for the first time in high school. When I saw chemistry for the first time, I thought it was the most terrible subject that might have ever been be created. The math involved along with the formulas and having to memorize all of the elements on the table of elements. Having to know each individual element’s symbol, each elements atomic weight, and having to know all the formulas was, at first, very intimidating. It took weeks and weeks of studying and the use of flash of cards to finally start to get the grasp of it. That’s what scared me the most about chemistry, was that I did everything I could do to help me pass and know everything possible to know during my course in high school and I just couldn’t do it. It was a heart breaker when I received my grade for the class. Let’s just say that I passed just barely, I got as close as possible to failing. Thankfully I didn’t fail. </p>
			<p>That was my freshman year in high school. I had to than take another chemistry class my junior year, or else I wouldn’t have enough credits to graduate from high school, and failing was never an option for me, so of course I took the class again. When I took the class for a second time, something was different. I go back and think about this all the time as to what was so different about it. Maybe it was the teacher and their teaching techniques? Maybe it was that I was a little bit more mature and I was able to focus a wee bit more than before? I can never put my finger on it, but something about that year and that class that made chemistry just click inside my head! I loved it so much.  All of the formulas, the elements, and all the other aspects of chemistry just seemed to come naturally the second time around. It just seemed like that I knew everything that was being taught. When it came to the time to receive your grades I did much, much, much better than freshman year chemistry. I passed chemistry my junior year with a 98%. I felt so relieved when I saw my grade for the class, almost a sense of relief.   </p>
			<p>I loved chemistry my junior year so much I took an AP chemistry class my senior year, even though I didn’t need another science credit to graduate I decided to go for it one more time before I do graduate. This is was my first look of what a college type class would be like, and what to expect the next year when I would go to the best college in the universe, Michigan State University! The class was very difficult as expected. We were introduced to concepts I had never seen before and of course there were concepts I had previously seen, which was nice. This was also the first time I’ve had to actually study for a class, because before I was just smart to show up and pass the class (except for chemistry freshman year that is). So the change was different and was hard to get used to. All in all I loved chemistry, just the same as the previous year. I also passed the class with a 92%, not as good as the year before, but I would still consider that an excellent grade, especially since it was an AP class. Now, although there were many other reasons why I chose chemistry as my major, including the type of career I wanted to get into. Completing and passing the AP course was the deciding factor in choosing chemistry as my major.</p>
			<p>There are many benefits of having an academic discipline such as chemistry as your choice of major. One benefit is that you can potentially make a boat load of cash with all of the careers you can achieve within a chem major (A chem major is just an abbreviation for chemistry major, for those who were confused). Dentist make some good money especially if they are good at what they do and own their own office. Chemical engineers make really good money as well. Also chemistry professors make a lot of cash as well. According to salary.com, Chemistry professors make an average of around $100,000 per year.  "Professor - Chemistry Salary | Salary.com." Salary.com. N.p., Mar. 2014. Web. 16 Mar. 2014. Not only are the careers you can get into a benefit of having a chemistry major, another benefit is that you can see the world around us a lot better. Chemistry is everywhere around us in our everyday life. Anywhere from that chemicals that help us clean our bathrooms, to the reason the leaves change from green I the summer to red and orange in the fall! 
</p>
			<p>The type of careers you can get into with chemistry are really rewarding in the long run. Most are very well paying jobs, such as dentistry for example. Dentist on average can make up to 200,000 dollars a year, if they are really good at what being a dentist and own their own dentist office that is.  "Dentist Salary | Salary.com." Salary.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. Dentistry is my career of choice and that’s only one of the many jobs you can get by becoming a chemistry major. Another job you can land is a chemical engineer Herbert, Solomon J. "Careers In Chemistry and Chemical Engineering." Http://search.proquest.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Mar. 2014.  Chemical engineers also make some really good money as well. “Chemical Engineer < 1 Year Experience: $51,710 - $66,286, Chemical Engineer with 1-4 Years Experience: $56,206 - $70,414, Chemical Engineer with 5-9 Years Experience: $64,618 - $84,19, Chemical Engineer with 10-19 Years Experience: $74,546 - $101,299, Chemical Engineer with More than 20 Years Experience: $83,304 - $126,418” "Chemical Engineering Salary." About.com Chemistry. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. More importantly, chemistry is in most jobs, even if that job doesn’t require you to have a major in chemistry. The article “why chemistry?” talks all about it. Chemistry seems to be everywhere around us.</p>
		        <p>Chemistry is involved with all kinds of careers and jobs. For example, would you ever think that a hair dresser is involved with chemistry? Me neither. A hair dresser is affiliated with chemistry because someone has to find the solution, or chemical formula, to know how to make a certain color dye or to perm hair. There are all kinds of ways chemistry is involved in a certain job. An exterminator is affiliated with chemistry because, as you probably already guessed, someone has to make the solutions to get rid of the pests and exterminate them. Without chemistry that wouldn’t be feasible and an exterminator would be the worst job on the planet because without the chemicals to rid of the bugs, he or she would have to find another way to kill the bugs, and every way I can think of exterminating is terrifying. I’m so glad chemistry exists. Be that as it may, chemistry isn’t all about chemicals as one might think. Even a chef is in some way connected to chemistry. This one came as a complete shock to me. There is no way a chef, is connected to chemistry, or so I thought. "A chef who knows how long to simmer tomato sauce is carrying out the chemical reactions that release the flavorful lycopene compounds from a tomato's cells.”  Mark Michalovic at the Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry.  Chemistry seems to be everywhere around us. Even something that is the complete opposite of science such as a hair dressing, is in some way tied in with chemistry. Geshelin, Hanna. "Why Chemistry?" Http://search.proquest.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/. Scholastic Inc., Feb.-Mar. 2004. Web. 14 Mar. 2014.</p>
			<p>I would now like to take a second to talk about chemistry as a whole and talk about why it is really important. I have been talking a bunch about why chemistry is important on an individual level, but now I want to say why the science behind chemistry is important and a grander scale. </p>
			<p>To start things off, the biggest reason chemistry is important to each and every single organism that is alive is because we are all made of chemicals and almost all that we observe in nature and space is made of chemicals. Also, we are all created because of chemical reactions. You, I, your neighbor Ted, and even your dog named Chester are made of chemicals. To understand everything around us we must understand things about ourselves, and chemistry is a great way to understand what makes us human and how we were created. Chemistry is also found outside of earth. The sun is made up of elements that allow it to keep burning while expending so much energy to sustain our eco system.  Another fun little fact is that, almost all the changes we observe in the natural world and even in the house hold are made or created by chemical reactions. We can observe this in nature with the annual changing of the leaves on tress. When we observe the leaves change from a bright green in the summer time, to when the leaves change to the lovely reds and oranges in the fall. Also when we use cleaning products to get rid of a mess. If the cleaning product is applied to a sticky substance such as cherry Kool-Aid for example, the product breaks down the Kool-Aid’s bonds in a chemical reaction and that allows for easier clean up, rather than scrubbing for 10 minutes and wasting your energy on one simple spill caused by a messy toddler trying to eat his lunch. Now, as you can see, chemistry is all around us. We come in contact with it almost every day.  We also observe chemistry all the time in the natural world and even in our house hold. </p>
		        <p>A big aspect of chemistry is the laboratory. The laboratory is where all the magic happens. Research is more times not than not done inside a laboratory, and if it isn’t done in a lab, I would probably say he or she is not a legitimate chemist and one should alert the authorities right away. Back to what we were saying about the lab, if someone is a new comer to the industry and only has a 2 year degree in chemistry, they could expect to wash the glass ware the chemist used in their experiments. Or you could be a teacher’s assistant and help set up the teacher set up labs for the students, but unfortunately you wouldn’t be able to progress much further without a higher degree. Now, if you have a 4 year degree this changes the story a little bit. With a four year degree, you can get what is called a bench job, which means you get to run equipment to the professor or scientist, whatever the case may be, and prepare chemicals for the scientists. Also, if you wish to continue your career in the lab even further, you can become a chemistry professor, which means you would get to work in a lab and teach college students in the art of chemistry. This is the route most students will take, if they are really passionate about chemistry. Now, if teaching isn’t something you are interested in, you could get into chemical engineering. If neither of those sound appealing to you and you would like to go further in your chemistry adventures, you could create your own research program. To create your own research program you would need a terminal degree. (A Terminal degree is the highest degree given in most disciplines.)  Helmenstine, Anne M., Ph.D. "What Are Some Careers in Chemistry?" About.com Chemistry. About.com, n.d. Web. 15 Mar. 2014.    "Terminal Degree." Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com, n.d. Web. 16 Mar. 2014.</p>
			<p>The last and final reason chemistry is so important is because it is so beneficial to society and, also the economy. Chemistry has helped out the world around us and without it, I hate to say this, a lot of us wouldn’t be alive today! Chemistry is the reason why we have prescription drugs to help us fight off viruses and many other lethal diseases. Without these prescription drugs, many of the people we care about and love wouldn’t be able to live as long as they do now that everyone can have access to potentially lifesaving drugs. Fortunately, chemistry does exist and everyone has the chance to live to 80, 90, even 100 years of age, all thanks to chemistry. I would say that we a pretty fortunate for having modern medicine. </p>
		        <p>Another reason chemistry is beneficial to society is because of all the man-helping chemicals that have been created because of, you guessed it, chemistry.  One example of this is chlorine. Most of us take this simple commercial chemical for granted every day. Many don’t know that without chlorine our water becomes undrinkable. Chlorine kills most of the water borne diseases. Diseases such as; Cholera, typhoid fever and dysentery are very dangerous diseases, which are all transmitted through impure drinking water, and chlorine kills all these diseases so you are able to drink water and not get utterly sick. Chlorine also has other practical uses besides helping you stay healthy. Chlorine is a compound used in producing Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) or plastic pipes, commonly used in plumping and transporting water. Another common use for chlorine is in bleaching agents. You like your white tees to be white and clean instead of dirty and yellow right? Yeah, me as well, and thanks to chlorine, a creation by the means of chemistry we are able to have that luxury. As you can see chemistry helps out so much in our society, and I only brought to light, two creations of chemistry and in those two creations alone, they have helped made our world a better, safer, and cleaner place. Khan, Adeel A. "Chemistry and Society." Ezinearticles.com. N.p., 08 Jan. 2010. Web. 16 Mar. 2014.</p>
			<p>Not only is chemistry beneficial to our society, it is also beneficial to our economy. So many creations have been made and sold because of chemistry. Every prescription drug you see in stores around the world is there because of chemistry. As I said chlorine is a product of chemistry and that is used to produce a grand number of cleaning products and those products are sold in stores so you the consumer can buy them. This is how chemistry helps with the economy. It helps build the stepping stone for creations that can be sold to the stores, which then can be sold to the consumer, then consumer then buys the product and everyone lives happily ever after! This is how I picture it in my mind at least. </p>
			<p>In this essay I talked a whole bunch about chemistry. I talked about taking chemistry in high school and how I came around to really becoming content with studying the subject. I talked about the many, many, many careers you can achieve with a chemistry major, and how much “mula” you could be making if you wish to take the dive and get a career in the chemistry field. I talked about the many benefits to being of being a chemistry major. Some of which were, making some really good money and understanding how and why things happen around us. I talked about working in a laboratory, and the many options you could have if would like to work in a lab while helping around with or scientists or possibly even running the lab yourself! I talked about why chemistry is important and how it’s involved in our everyday lives. I talked about how chemistry is beneficial to our society. It helps keep us healthy and gives us the ability to fight off disease, and therefore allows us to live longer. I also talked about how chemistry is beneficial to our economy. In that it allows people to create products that can be sold in stores around the world. All in all, I talked about the importance of chemistry in its many aspects. Most importantly I talked about why you should consider chemistry as your academic discipline.</p>

                <p>I felt that the poem he wrote was straight from the heart. While he was reading you could see that he 
                was getting really emotional and he even started tearing up. Just knowing that he wrote that from the heart makes 
                the poem as a whole so much better, it was already well writen in the first place and that extra touch just put 
                it all together. I also liked how he brought to life such a touchy subject such as suicide. It's never easy to 
                talk about suicide, espically when its a close family memeber. So for him to make a video about it and also 
                come out as gay takes a lot of guts.</p>

                <p>That was the funniest south park episode I have ever seen! It targeted people who play online
                video games or, more specifically, World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft, from what I hear and just watched 
                is a computer game that you play online and you go around doing quests. A couple of my friends play World of Warcraft
                and they say that it is really addicting. This south park was making fun of the people who take the game 
                too seriously, and do nothing but stay inside and play on the computer all day. I myself enjoy videos from time
                to time, but i could never say inside all day and just sit there playing. No offense to those who do, what ever makes
                you happy right? I'm just saying me persoally i couldn't do it. Back to the episode of south park, i think what the 
                makers of south park were trying to say, was that, it's still important for kids to go outside and play and be creative.
                It is also more healthy to go outside and run around, than sitting around in a chair wating hot pockets like Carmin.

                <p>I felt that the poem he wrote was straight from the heart. 
                While he was reading you could see that he was getting really emotional and he even started tearing up.
                Knowing that he wrote that comine from the heart makes the poem as a whole that much better. It was already
                well writen in the first place. All in all i like the video and the poem.</p>

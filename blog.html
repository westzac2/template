                <p>     I felt that the poem he wrote was straight from the heart. 
                While he was reading you could see that he was getting really emotional and he even started tearing up.
                Just knowing that he wrote that from the heart makes the poem as a whole so much better, it was already
                well writen in the first place and that extra touch just put it all together. I also liked how he brought to 
                life such a touchy subject such as suicide. It's never easy to talk about suicide, espically when its a close family memeber. 
                So for him to make a video about it and also come out as gay takes a lot of guts.</p>
